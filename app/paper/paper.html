      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
        This paper discusses the creation of several popular programming languages used in the web
        sphere. It touches on the idea that most of these languages evolved out of necessity, and describes
        what those requirements were. It then goes on to describe what we might see in the future of the world
        wide web.

      <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        It all began with the web browser, a program on your computer that interprets web code and renders it
        into the web pages you can see. The first popular version of which was called Mosaic created by Marc 
        Andreessen. It was available only on X-Windows and Unix
        when first created, and was later ported to Macintosh OS. It was eventually released for free in 1993
        and helped grow the internet greatly at the time. This early browser introduced some pretty huge concepts 
        such as forms, bookmarks, and even video clips
        (<a href="#/paper#stewart">Stewart, 2016</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Mosaic's rights were eventually given to Spyglass, Inc. and licensed out to other companies, one of which
        was Microsoft, who would go on to create the Internet Explorer we know today. Development on Mosaic was halted
        in 1997, after which Microsoft brought over teams to help build out Internet Explorer into a popular, and workable
        browser for the average consumer (<a href="#/paper#stewart">Stewart, 2016</a>).
