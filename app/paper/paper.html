      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p>
        This paper discusses the creation of several popular programming languages used in the web
        sphere. It touches on the idea that most of these languages evolved out of necessity, and describes
        what those requirements were. It then goes on to describe what we might see in the future of the world
        wide web.

      <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        It all began with the web browser, a program on your computer that interprets web code and renders it into the web pages you can see. The first popular version of which was called Mosaic created by Marc Andreessen. It was available only on X-Windows and Unix when first created, and was later ported to Macintosh OS. It was eventually released for free in 1993 and helped grow the internet greatly at the time. This early browser introduced some pretty huge concepts such as forms, bookmarks, and even video clips
        (<a href="#/paper#stewart">Stewart, 2016</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Mosaic's rights were eventually given to Spyglass, Inc. and licensed out to other companies, one of which was Microsoft, who would go on to create the Internet Explorer we know today. Development on Mosaic was halted in 1997, after which Microsoft brought over teams to help build out Internet Explorer into a popular, and workable browser for the average consumer (<a href="#/paper#stewart">Stewart, 2016</a>).

      <h3 id="browser">The Beginning: HTML</h3>
      <p>
        It is of course that web browsers would not have been able to get off the ground without the invention of a 
        universal language for writing web pages. This is where HTML began, and where it would evolve to still be used today. HTML began its life at a physics researching lab in Switzerland called CERN. The inital concept, credited to Tim Berners-Lee was to be able to linktogether texts in different research papers from remote sites together. And so the world wide web began to take shape, as this generally agreed upon structure for a publishing language took shape (<a href="#/paper#longman">Longman, 1998</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout the 1990s, groups would organize to discuss the future of html as a markup language, and new tags would be added. We even saw such attributes as font face and bgcolor emerge, even though at the time, it was generally understood that html would only describe the layout of the content, and not the design. This concept carries through to today's modern web, although there are many times when this idea is ignored in favor of convenience 
        (<a href="#/paper#longman">Longman, 1998</a>).

      <h3 id="css">The Colorful Web: CSS</h3>
      <p>
        In the midst of the evolving language of HTML, there was a distinction I discussed earlier, which 
        sought to separate the design of a page, with the layout. Now that there was an agreed upon way to format
        a web page, the design would follow after. Initially, each browser was left to its own to display a page's
        design, and theoretically, a page could look different, design wise in each one, while leaving the
        HTML content the same. In fact, as the years went on, browsers were allowing less and less customization, to the point where you could only change some font styles and colors (<a href="#/paper#lie">Lie, 1999</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Like any other technology, this would later be revolutionized in newer browsers. Eventually, at the WWW conference in 1995 when CSS was presented for a second time with live examples, it was agreed that the user should ultimately have control over the visual elements of the HTML content. With that, work on a universal cascading sylesheet language continued (<a href="#/paper#lie">Lie, 1999</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn't until late 1995 that W3C, the organization that sets a standardized reccommendation for how the web ought to be, finally decided to work on a CSS specification. Once this standard was set, Microsoft and the authors of Netscape began to introduce CSS support. Later, in 1997, CSS finally got its own group as part of W3C, which could then begin creating a better specification for the language, and fill gaps that the original CSS left open. This group would go on to further refine the CSS specification to what we have today (<a href="#/paper#lie">Lie, 1999</a>).

      <h3 id="serverside">Databases, Templates, and Requests: Serverside Languages</h3>
      <p>
        During the time when CSS was being specified, and implemented in some major browsers, there were also big things happening with serverside technology. Originally starting out as a simple set of serverside binaries, created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf, PHP is one such serverside improvement. The original set of binaries was created to allow him to track views on his online resume. He then improved upon, and released to the public these tools under the name PHP tools. It would go through two more major re-writes in 1995 and 1996, after which it began to fully evolve into a serverside scripting language that could be embedded into HTML files and executed. Some of these abilities involved accessing Postgres and mSql databases (<a href="#/paper#php">PHP: History</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Another such serverside technology is ASP.NET MVC, coming out around 2007, a much later contender to the backend game. Like PHP, ASP.NET can access databases and dynamically change pages, as well as handle form data. Where they differ, is the back-end service that handles these requests. ASP.NET runs using Microsoft's .NET framework, and not through another program or runtime. It also contains a framework for controllers and data-model binding from HTML forms to make data handling simpler. This has seen several iterations, and is absolutely still used today (<a href="#/paper#chiaretta">Chiaretta 2011</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        A third, equally potent contender in the serverside technology battle is JSP, or Java Server Pages. It is quite similar to ASP.NET in that it runs on its respective languages's runtime, and not another, in this case a Java application. Java Server Pages first appeared from Sun Microsystems in 1999, and is the most widely used type of serverside Java toolkit. It takes the simplicity of PHP in that you can embed Java code into HTML and execute it to access data from the Java server (<a href="#/paper#holzner">Holzner 2003</a>).
